# UDON-Palette-Color-Picker-Fork

As part of the licence for using this here color picker, I've had to distribute my modifications under this developer's OWL licence here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KD7pf2Lf26qU76toraf_AHrWeC2bZY1BItXU01FYprA/edit?tab=t.0

This is a drop in replacement for the QuadColorPicker script included with the packaging. So if you delete that file and add this one instead, you'll have my changes.

It removes the syncing between users, as I didn't need it personally for this usage in scipio. It also sets the default color, and can accept multiple materials. There is a field for setting what you want to have change added too, but I eventually decided to forego making it my only usecase. So this sets the poiyomi world emission colors 0-2 as well as a hardcoded feature.
